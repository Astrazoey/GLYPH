### Dungeon rules ###

Basics:
	Dungeons will always generate in a square grid of the same size (depending on difficulty)
	Dungeons will always make a path that starts with the start room,
		has an artifact half way through,
		and ends with an end room
	There is a set maximum number of specific room types per dungeon in a given difficulty
	Rooms will never have more than 3 connecting rooms

Start Room:
	The start room will always have at least 3 paths branching out of it
	The start room will never generate on the edge of a dungeon
	The rooms next to the start room will always be empty

Enemies:
	Enemies will never generate next to other enemies or teleporters
	Enemies of the same type will always have the same stats
	The only time enemies can be next to each other is if they swap rooms after generation (due to trap)
	On harder difficulties, a boss will always appear next to an artifact

Teleporters:
	Teleporters will never generate next to enemies or other teleporters
	Teleporter exits will never generate on the dungeon edges




Warning room priority is as follows:
	1. Tough enemies
	2. Enemies
	3. Mimics
	4. Teleporters
	5. Nothing
